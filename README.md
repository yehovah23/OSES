Hey there! I’m David, a passionate software engineer and lifelong learner. If you’re looking for someone who can debug Python code while telling a sarcastic anecdote about real life, you’ve found your guy.

- 📚 Always learning—currently mastering the art of juggling “student life” and “engineer life.”
- 😎 I believe every project should have a sense of humor (and robust error handling).
